# Emverst - My Wellness Journey

## 💭 Why I Built This

I created Emverst to document and share my personal journey toward a healthier lifestyle. This app is a collection of my habits, experiences, and learnings across three essential pillars of wellness:

- **🍽️ Eat**: The healthy recipes I cook and enjoy
- **🏃‍♀️ Move**: My exercise routines and physical activities
- **🧘‍♀️ Rest**: Recovery techniques and rest practices that work for me

While this is primarily for my personal use to track and organize my wellness habits, I'm sharing it openly in hopes that it might inspire or help others on their own wellness journey.

## 🌟 What's Inside

- **Recipe Collection**: Real recipes I've tried, tested, and loved - from traditional Indonesian dishes to healthy everyday meals
- **Exercise Documentation**: Movement practices and exercises that keep me active
- **Rest & Recovery**: Relaxation techniques and recovery methods I practice
- **Bilingual**: Available in Indonesian (my native language) and English to share with a wider audience

## 🌍 Languages

Available in Indonesian (default) and English:
- **Indonesian**: `http://localhost:4321/`
- **English**: `http://localhost:4321/en/`

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
